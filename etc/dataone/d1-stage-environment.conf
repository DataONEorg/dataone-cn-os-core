# This file is used to pre-seed the debconf configuration database with values for the
# DataONE stage environment.  It gets called from the postinst script if the
# cn.context.label value is STAGE

# If you need to set up a CN stage environment, change the values
# here prior to installing the deb packages in cn-buildout. If you want to add
# debconf properties, be sure to add an entry in the templates file that
# corresponds with the property being preset here.
